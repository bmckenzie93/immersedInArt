  Notes from Maura:
  EEWWW I just thought of something - I really want to do a timeline, or scrap book or anthology of the last 10 years. Maybe we scrap this and do that?!!!!! HMMMMMM. The ten years of offthewallgraffiti - loads and loads of photos and my written words, video footage… DREAM COME TRUE.

  I actually have a bunch of photos which I can put up on the Facebook page - Immersed In Art.
  It would be cool to have a photo section maybe? I am hosting on pod bean, which you will likely need the embed code from… just let me know. If you want to log in and view our wordpress site you can do that.

  This is so much fun! I really think we should use this site as a place that they can go to to say “YES! I have a story I want to tell and I want to be on the pod! Here’s a little bit about what my story is - 
  Here’s my email - Or it connects them to my email?


  [12:34am]
  I started this project by E-mailing maura to ask her what kind of site I could make for her, and asked a few questions about what she wanted. I took the answers she provided and pasted them above here in the read me section to referance while designing this project.

  [12:59am]
  I just looked at all the websites sent to me. Woah, they were trippy. I'm going to bed now.

  I did some sketching and browsing to see what kind of design I want to go for on this project. I want to use a video background above the fold for the landing page. I'll start there. I got a vidoe to use on coverr.io for now - I will see if Maura has any mp4's she would want to use instead.

  [1:16pm]
  I set up my sass files following the 7-1 archatecture method for this project. I want all of my code to be modular, reusable, and scalable! 

  [3:18pm]
  I've been working on the header so far today. For the background I've used a video with a color gradient wash over it. On top I have the logo to the left, and some introductory text to the right.

  [3:45pm]
  I did a static deployment via Netlify so that this project can be viewed during development by my client at https://flamboyant-noether-04fe12.netlify.app

  [5:42pm]
  Ive been working on the about section, i'm about to put some images on the side. I just added them to my image folder. I need Maura to revise the copy I wrote and send me the exact photos she might want for this section.

  [6:54pm]
  I've got the about section laid out..

  [11:11pm]
  I got off earlier at 7 to join an online tech meetup which I sat creepily in not saying a word. I just hopped back on real quick to change the colors in the heading and add some animation to it.

  I got called off of work today, so I get to code! woohoo! 

  [3:08pm]
  I've been working on these key cards this whole time.. Ive been trying to get the text to change on hover using only css and I found a new way using the data attribute. Now that I am doing it this way I no longer need to position a card back absolutely over the card front on hover, so Im having to re-write the html and css to remove the card back's that I had made and put the flex containers on other elements now zZzzzz 

  [4:17pm]
  That was so fun! It took a while to get it to work but I finally got it to do what I wanted!! The text changes on hover and the icon stays above too. I had to do some psudo-selecting a few levels deep to get it to work. yay!

  [5:05pm]
  I just spent about 45min tinkering around with the code so that when the key cards scaled up on hover it wouldnt resize the parent div. That should NOT have taken that long lol. Got it though!

  [6:31pm]
  Emails exchanged, new game plan. This is going to be a call to action page for artists to submit interest in talking on the podcast.

  From here I want to create the footer, and a pop up modal form. The form sounds more fun to create so ill do that first!
