  Notes from Maura:
  EEWWW I just thought of something - I really want to do a timeline, or scrap book or anthology of the last 10 years. Maybe we scrap this and do that?!!!!! HMMMMMM. The ten years of offthewallgraffiti - loads and loads of photos and my written words, video footage… DREAM COME TRUE.

  I actually have a bunch of photos which I can put up on the Facebook page - Immersed In Art.
  It would be cool to have a photo section maybe? I am hosting on pod bean, which you will likely need the embed code from… just let me know. If you want to log in and view our wordpress site you can do that.

  I started this project by E-mailing maura to ask her what kind of site I could make for her, and asked a few questions about what she wanted. I took the answers she provided and pasted them above here in the read me section to referance while designing this project.

  I just looked at all the websites sent to me. Woah, they were trippy. I'm going to bed now.

  I did some sketching and browsing to see what kind of design I want to go for on this project. I want to use a video background above the fold for the landing page. I'll start there. I got a vidoe to use on coverr.io for now - I will see if Maura has any mp4's she would want to use instead.

  [1:16pm]
  I set up my sass files following the 7-1 archatecture method for this project. I want all of my code to be modular, reusable, and scalable! 

  [3:18pm]
  I've been working on the header so far today. For the background I've used a video with a color gradient wash over it. On top I have the logo to the left, and some introductory text to the right.
